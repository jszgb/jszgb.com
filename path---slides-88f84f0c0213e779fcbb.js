The talk compares a few of the most popular: WebdriverJS, WebdriverIO and Nightwatch.js. </p>\n<h3>Ivan Vuković</h3>\n<h4>Declaring peace with React Native animations</h4>\n<p>Writing React Native animations requires a lot of code that can’t be reused easily, even for most common functions, like fade or zoom. With high order components animations can be declarative and simple to use. This concept has been introduced with Shoutem UI Toolkit and is proven as a success. Animations should be easy; let\'s declare peace with them!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Meetup #32 (15.02.2017)</h2>\n<h3>Vjekoslav Ratkajec</h3>\n<h4><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/VjekoslavRatkajec/office-addin-development">Earning cash on MS Office with JS</a></h4>\n<p>Microsoft is switching gears by focusing on developers and web technologies.

You can use it to model all kinds of data: from simple arrays of values, series of events (unfortunate or otherwise), complex flows of data, to HTTP requests. I\'ll explain what is an Observable, what is RxJS and why/where/how you can use it.</p>\n<p>Code from the demo is available on <a href="https://github.com/DyslexicDcuk/jszgb-meetup-rxjs">Github</a></p>\n<h3>Tomislav Tenodi</h3>\n<h4>Rapid development with React Native</h4>\n<p>React Native is an awesome technology for building native mobile apps. Its well designed architecture makes it possible to learn one stack and leverage it on the multiple platforms. However, creating an app remains a cumbersome task. Did we reach the maximum development efficiency? Shoutem designed the first-ever plugin architecture to eliminate all the boilerplate steps when building an app, with open-sourced plugins, cloud storage and automated publishing to both app stores. In this presentation, I will give a demo on how to build a React Native plugin along with creating a unique, production-ready application.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Meetup #30 (21.12.2016)</h2>\n<h3><a href="https://github.com/dinkom">Dinko Mihovilović</a></h3>\n<h4>React + React Storybook + atomic design</h4>\n<p>A demo which will take you through writing a small React app following the principles of atomic design (which will also be briefly covered) and tested with React-Storybook.</p>\n<p>React Storybook is a UI development environment for testing React components. It enables you to interactively test each component separately in isolation, ensuring that they perform as expected. React Storybook can also be expanded to play along with other testing libraries (such as Enzyme), which this talk will also attempt to demonstrate.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/dinodsaurus">Dino Trojak</a></h3>\n<h4><a href="http://slides.com/dinotrojak/create-react-app-2-3#/">React native</a></h4>\n<p>There is a lot of talk about React in our user group.

We will try to make it easier using Redux.</p>\n<p>Redux is predictable state management container for JavaScript applications that helps us manage our state while also making our state mutations predictable.\nThrough the presentation and code, I will show you how I solved my state problem with Redux in React application.</p>\n<p>Code from the demo is available on <a href="https://github.com/wedranb/lorem-trumpsum">Github</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Meetup #28 (19.10.2016)</h2>\n<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/silvenon">Matija Marohnić</a></h3>\n<h4>Unicorn against JavaScript Fatigue</h4>\n<p> Starting a React applications is becoming increasingly difficult and the choice fatigue has gone through the roof. So. Many. Tools. In the great kingdom of Facebook a unicorn has been born. Its name is "create-react-app" (not the most elegant name for a unicorn) and its destiny is to fight JavaScript Fatigue, a vicious monster who\'s making developers all over the world miserable. Unlike React boilerplates, create-react-app abstracts away all the implementation details of serving, transpiling, testing etc. They are all hidden behind a dependency, so you don\'t have to worry about accidentally messing something up or even just looking at all that intimidating configuration. Unlike similar solutions, create-react-app is "official"!</p>\n<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/shimewastaken">Hrvoje Šimić</a></h3>\n<h4>How I made my first somewhat popular open source tool</h4>\n<p>Two years ago I made Livedown, a tool for previewing Markdown files from your editor and it has since been downloaded 8k times. I made it because I wasn\'t happy with solutions at the time and decided to write it in JavaScript to support multiple editors.</p>\n<p>I\'ll share what I\'ve learned and give some general tips on how to write useful open source tools.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Meetup #27 (15.6.2016)</h2>\n<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/LukaBlazecki">Luka Blažecki</a></h3>\n<h4><a href="http://share.snacktools.com/97F65E6EFB5/b7xcspmu">Writing readable async code in JS</a></h4>\n<p>Intro to callbacks, promises and async/await.</p>\n<p>We all started writing JS code with callbacks (hell). And it sucked a lot. Then promises came. They solved a lot of problems, like error handling and timing. But sometimes flow and readability are too complicated or hold too much additional syntax. This is what async/await is resolving.\nNow JS can finally be fun to write even when there is complicated flow!</p>\n<p>Some additional resources on Promises:</p>\n<p><a href="http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/getting-started.html">Bluebird promise library</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://promise-nuggets.github.io/">Promise nuggets</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://blog.getify.com/promises-wrong-ways/">Promises: All The Wrong Ways</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://blog.domenic.me/youre-missing-the-point-of-promises/#toc_1">You\'re Missing the Point of Promises</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://zeit.co/blog/async-and-await?utm_source=javascriptweekly&#x26;utm_medium=email">Async and Await </a></p>\n<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/silvenon">Matija Marohnić</a></h3>\n<h4><a href="http://slides.com/silvenon/you-dont-need-jquery">You (probably) don\'t need jQuery (anymore)</a></h4>\n<p>There was a time when browsers were handling DOM, AJAX etc. very differently. Normalizing these manually was a pain, so libraries like jQuery were invaluable. Now that browsers have more-or-less agreed upon these things and frameworks have started to rise, jQuery has become an unnecessary abstraction and might be preventing you from getting better at JavaScript. I will show you how to achieve common tasks without it, so you can decide whether you really need it.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Meetup #26 (18.5.2016)</h2>\n<h3><a href="https://github.com/Vj3k0">Vjekoslav Ratkajec</a></h3>\n<h4>Making desktop apps with Electron</h4>\n<p>Electron enables you to create cross-platform desktop apps with web technologies.

In a pool of popular framework options Ember JS was chosen for the client side rewrite! Ember is great and well established JS framework which shares a lot of design decisions and ideas with Rails.</p>\n<p>This talk will cover the process of switching from Rails only app to API based backend + Ember JS app and it will try to show why choosing Ember really was a good decision.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Meetup #24 (16.3.2016)</h2>\n<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/vratkajec">Vjekoslav Ratkajec</a></h3>\n<h4><a href="http://www.slidesnack.com/my-slidesnack/details/?slide=bhkmwifj">Introduction to Electron</a></h4>\n<p>Electron enables you to create cross-platform desktop apps with web technologies.

Our tools to manipulate those files reflect this. What we usually forget is that each of those files has a life of its own and eventually becomes a programmatically inspectable syntax tree. What if we took advantage of this and used it to make smarter coding tools? I tried to examine this concept and created a small command line toolkit which tries to utilize it. I will explain how a syntax-aware diff could be created and exploit the syntax tree further to create a smarter merge tool as well.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Meetup #19 (22.10.2015)</h2>\n<h3><a href="https://github.com/silvenon">Matija Marohnić</a></h3>\n<h4><a href="https://github.com/silvenon/jszg-react">Creating and Testing UIs with React</a> (Part 1)</h4>\n<p>We’ll set up JavaScript compilation with Babel and Webpack, so we can split our app into separate modules (i.e. files). We will execute these tasks inside <code>package.json</code>, but it doesn’t really matter which one you use.</p>\n<p>Once we get that working, we will build a very simple UI to demonstrate basic React concepts and best practices.
