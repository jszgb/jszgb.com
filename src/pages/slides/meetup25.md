#### [Streaming in JavaScript](https://slides.com/miloszchmura/streaming-in-javascript/)

In programming, problems can be tackled using various ways. When it comes to data processing, a useful approach is using pipes and streaming.

In this presentation I will show you how I came up with solution to a simple interview task using streaming approach in Node.js. Furthermore, I will show you the great benefits of this approach: performance and processing of infinite amount of data.

#### [Cheating on Rails with Ember](http://bit.ly/cheating-on-rails-with-ember)

Maintaining client side of a big saas product can be hard in a monolithic, server oriented architecture like Rails - UX, performance and code quality usually suffer. In a pool of popular framework options Ember JS was chosen for the client side rewrite! Ember is great and well established JS framework which shares a lot of design decisions and ideas with Rails.

This talk will cover the process of switching from Rails only app to API based backend + Ember JS app and it will try to show why choosing Ember really was a good decision.
