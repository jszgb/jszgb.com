#### [RxJS - Reactive programming, Observables, timeless patterns and new implementations](http://slides.com/damirsehic/rxjs)

RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library for transforming, composing, and querying streams of data. You can use it to model all kinds of data: from simple arrays of values, series of events (unfortunate or otherwise), complex flows of data, to HTTP requests. I'll explain what is an Observable, what is RxJS and why/where/how you can use it.

Code from the demo is available on [Github](https://github.com/DyslexicDcuk/jszgb-meetup-rxjs)

#### Rapid development with React Native

React Native is an awesome technology for building native mobile apps. Its well designed architecture makes it possible to learn one stack and leverage it on the multiple platforms. However, creating an app remains a cumbersome task. Did we reach the maximum development efficiency? Shoutem designed the first-ever plugin architecture to eliminate all the boilerplate steps when building an app, with open-sourced plugins, cloud storage and automated publishing to both app stores. In this presentation, I will give a demo on how to build a React Native plugin along with creating a unique, production-ready application.
