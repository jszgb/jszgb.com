### [Matija Marohnić](https://github.com/silvenon)
#### [Creating and Testing UIs with React](https://github.com/silvenon/jszg-react) (Part 1)

We’ll set up JavaScript compilation with Babel and Webpack, so we can split our app into separate modules (i.e. files). We will execute these tasks inside `package.json`, but it doesn’t really matter which one you use.

Once we get that working, we will build a very simple UI to demonstrate basic React concepts and best practices. You will learn what React is, by seeing how it works first-hand. We will not go into much theory, no comparisons with existing MV\* frameworks. Just hands-on LIVE CODING! \*gasp\*

After Matija is done with his app, we will explain how tests in React work and we will install all necessary things to run them. Tests will be done using Jest. Jest is an open source testing utility from Facebook. It makes unit testing React a lot easier. There wont be any theoretical stuff. Live examples only. We will also run our tests on Travis, so you’ll see how to add that shiny Travis badge to your repo.
