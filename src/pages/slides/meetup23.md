#### [Backbone stickit - how to do two way data binding in backbone](http://www.slidesnack.com/my-slidesnack/details/?slide=b7x349ik)

When developing Backbone apps we often need the view to be in sync with model and vice versa. To avoid getting lost in Backbone boilerplate code with multiple listeners and events, we can easily use Stickit - one of the two-way data binding implementations available for Backbone. In this small presentation I will show you how you can use it with simple input element and more complex elements like select.

#### [Forget Google Maps. Meet D3.js](http://svemir.co/d3/#/)

D3.js is JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data to create interactive data visualizations. By interactive data visualizations, I do not mean only charts, but much more interesting stuff, like interactive maps for example. In this talk, we will cover everything needed to create an interactive map with D3.js, including where to find free data, how to add interactivity, and how to style the map using only CSS.
