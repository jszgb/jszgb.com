#### [How to write your own yeoman generator](http://www.slideshare.net/slaventomac/how-to-write-your-own-yeoman-generator)

Yeoman is being used for easy scaffolding of your project. There is a ton of Yeoman generators online, but what if you don't like any of them and you want something different. This is a possibility for you to create your own Yeoman generator.

I will give short introduction through slideshow/code how you can create simple Yeoman generator, publish it and make developers start using it.

#### [React state management with Redux](http://www.slideshare.net/VedranBlaenka/react-state-managmenet-with-redux)

When developing applications we have a hard time managing application state, and that is okay because managing application state is hard. We will try to make it easier using Redux.

Redux is predictable state management container for JavaScript applications that helps us manage our state while also making our state mutations predictable.
Through the presentation and code, I will show you how I solved my state problem with Redux in React application.

Code from the demo is available on [Github](https://github.com/wedranb/lorem-trumpsum).
