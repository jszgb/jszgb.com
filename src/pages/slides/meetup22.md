#### [Integration tests in node.js](http://www.slidesnack.com/my-slidesnack/details/?slide=b7n07fa3)

Everyone is talking about how testing is important, but there is little talk about what the tests look like in a slightly bigger Node.js application. Nor is there talk about the encountered problems or possible solutions. Through this talk I would like to start a discussion about one part of the testing through integration tests in the web / API Node.js.

#### [Unpacking Webpack](https://github.com/silvenon/jszg-webpack)

There seems to be a new build tool released every month. Grunt, Gulp, Broccoli, Brunch... So why should you care about Webpack? Because it's so much more than a build tool, it's a complete module bundler with less configuration required. It's extremely powerful and deserves much more attention.
