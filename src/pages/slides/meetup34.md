#### Snapshot testing to the rescue

Snapshot testing is useful for hunting down unexpected regressions in your application. Jest is the first testing framework which introduced snapshot testing (AVA recently also added that feature). It is most often used for testing React components, but it can be used for any JavaScript object.

Matija will show you how snapshot testing can speed up your unit testing workflow and when to use it.
