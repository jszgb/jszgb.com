#### React state management with Rematch

State management is a hot topic, with a lot of libraries trying to tackle the problem in their unique way. Redux seems to have taken a strong lead, with a huge community behind it and great documentation. But is there a way to do even better? Can we improve on Redux ideas to make developer experience better? In this talk, we’ll talk about Rematch, a state management library that strives to push Redux to the next level.

#### React + Flow: Dive in

All programmers have a special part of our brains exclusively dedicated to introduce bugs in our apps, even if we don’t like to admit it, we make typos, pass wrong data and return unicorns where a number was expected. So relying on a static analysis tool like Flow to keep an eye on our code, will not only help us avoid having those issues but more importantly by doing so we’ll look smarter. This talk will take you to some of the basics and relevance of the type system and then dive deep into typing a react app.
