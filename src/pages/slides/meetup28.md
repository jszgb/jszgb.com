#### Unicorn against JavaScript Fatigue

 Starting a React applications is becoming increasingly difficult and the choice fatigue has gone through the roof. So. Many. Tools. In the great kingdom of Facebook a unicorn has been born. Its name is "create-react-app" (not the most elegant name for a unicorn) and its destiny is to fight JavaScript Fatigue, a vicious monster who's making developers all over the world miserable. Unlike React boilerplates, create-react-app abstracts away all the implementation details of serving, transpiling, testing etc. They are all hidden behind a dependency, so you don't have to worry about accidentally messing something up or even just looking at all that intimidating configuration. Unlike similar solutions, create-react-app is "official"!

#### How I made my first somewhat popular open source tool

Two years ago I made Livedown, a tool for previewing Markdown files from your editor and it has since been downloaded 8k times. I made it because I wasn't happy with solutions at the time and decided to write it in JavaScript to support multiple editors.

I'll share what I've learned and give some general tips on how to write useful open source tools.
