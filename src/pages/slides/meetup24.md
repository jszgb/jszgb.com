#### [Introduction to Electron](http://www.slidesnack.com/my-slidesnack/details/?slide=bhkmwifj)

Electron enables you to create cross-platform desktop apps with web technologies. It is based on Chromium and uses Node.js to enable working with OS, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for UI.

For years I've been working as an ActionScript developer making cross-platform apps in Adobe AIR. Few months ago I've started to work with Electron. I'm also writing my thoughts and findings on my blog [Electron Rocks](http://electron.rocks/)!

Save time and be more productive. Expose local servers behind NATs and firewalls to the public internet over secure tunnels.
