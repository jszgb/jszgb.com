### [Dinko MihoviloviÄ‡](https://github.com/dinkom)
#### React + React Storybook + atomic design

A demo which will take you through writing a small React app following the principles of atomic design (which will also be briefly covered) and tested with React-Storybook.

React Storybook is a UI development environment for testing React components. It enables you to interactively test each component separately in isolation, ensuring that they perform as expected. React Storybook can also be expanded to play along with other testing libraries (such as Enzyme), which this talk will also attempt to demonstrate.

#### [React native](http://slides.com/dinotrojak/create-react-app-2-3#/)

There is a lot of talk about React in our user group. In this talk it will be shown how to leverage React knowledge in the native development with real life experience from working with React native on a production app. Also, we will scaffold, build and also publish our jsZgb app.

Code from the demo is available on [Github](https://github.com/jszgb/mobile).
