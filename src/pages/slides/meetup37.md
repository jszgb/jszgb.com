#### Building a crude Node from scratch

We all know that Node is a JavaScript runtime powered by V8, a JavaScript engine by Google Chrome, but how does that relationship work? What is a JavaScript engine anyway? What is a JavaScript runtime? In this talk I’m gonna demystify this relationship and build a very crude implementation of Node, that only supports console.log statements.

#### WebVR

WebVR is an experimental browser API that makes it possible to experience VR in your browser. The goal is to make it easier for everyone to get into VR experiences, no matter what device you have. In this talk I'll demo a simple multiplayer VR game and talk about the implementation and lessons learned.
