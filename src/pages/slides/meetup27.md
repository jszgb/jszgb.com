#### [Writing readable async code in JS](http://share.snacktools.com/97F65E6EFB5/b7xcspmu)

Intro to callbacks, promises and async/await.

We all started writing JS code with callbacks (hell). And it sucked a lot. Then promises came. They solved a lot of problems, like error handling and timing. But sometimes flow and readability are too complicated or hold too much additional syntax. This is what async/await is resolving.
Now JS can finally be fun to write even when there is complicated flow!

Some additional resources on Promises:

#### [You (probably) don't need jQuery (anymore)](http://slides.com/silvenon/you-dont-need-jquery)

There was a time when browsers were handling DOM, AJAX etc. very differently. Normalizing these manually was a pain, so libraries like jQuery were invaluable. Now that browsers have more-or-less agreed upon these things and frameworks have started to rise, jQuery has become an unnecessary abstraction and might be preventing you from getting better at JavaScript. I will show you how to achieve common tasks without it, so you can decide whether you really need it.
