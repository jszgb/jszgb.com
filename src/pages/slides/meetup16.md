### Joso Mrša
#### WebGL – The Third Dimension of the Web

WebGL compatibility has come to most platforms, so its time to see what all the fuss is about. We will exlore the basics of presenting 3D content using three.js Javascript library.

### Mario Jurić
#### [Backbone JS + Web Components, Make 'em Dance](http://slides.com/jurza/backbonejs-and-web-components#/)

Web Components are a set of standards that aim to solve some of the problems web developers are currently facing. On a small demo app we'll try to showcase some Web Components concepts and with the help of basic Backbone features bring some structure to the code. Music wishes will be free :)
