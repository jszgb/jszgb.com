Thank you [Five](http://five.agency/) for your hospitality!

Last Saturday, we had another NodeSchool workshop. We had a super-productive day where participants learned to write their first JavaScript application, through a set of self-paced challenges (and a little help from our guys), and they successfully managed it! Great atmosphere, socializing and learning led to new skills and successful workshop.

Check how it was in this awesome [gallery](https://web.facebook.com/FiveNYC/photos/ms.c.eJxNzskNwEAIA8COIg4vR~;~_NRQEt5DsyNuyuFKJHXJFHHm4QGFlI2gVwgecFtg~_UcEHRHbodBTaA6A7ZjgSxqQ94w2~_2gOcEnaBJSL9usn~;USmwHVQL~_AlN2MAA~-.bps.a.1773082146068306.1073741866.151026981607172/1773082246068296/?type=3&theater)!
