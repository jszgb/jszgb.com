This time we will talk about [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/), a tool for building cross platform desktop apps which was initially developed for [Githubs atom](https://atom.io/) editor and [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

## Introduction to Electron

#### Vjekoslav Ratkajec

Electron enables you to create cross-platform desktop apps with web technologies. It is based on Chromium and uses Node.js to enable working with OS, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for UI.

For years I've been working as an ActionScript developer making cross-platform apps in Adobe AIR. Few months ago I've started to work with Electron. I'm also writing my thoughts and findings on my blog Electron Rocks!


## ngrok - Secure tunnels to localhost

#### Mihaela Mihaljević Jakić

Save time and be more productive. Expose local servers behind NATs and firewalls to the public internet over secure tunnels.
