We have a new Slack channel up and running and you can sign up for it here https://jszgb-slack.herokuapp.com/

And we have made a more user friendly github repo https://github.com/jszgb/jszgb.github.io

We think that this two changes will add a great value to our community and that they will for sure bring up the quality of our meetups.
