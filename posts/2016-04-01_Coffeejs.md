JavaScript and other tech professionals non-formal social meeting.

Today, on April 1st 2016., another CoffeeJS Zagreb Meetup took place in Kino Europa at 9 o'clock. Again we had the same number of 5 enthusiasts as last time but this time some new faces shown up.

In relaxing atmosphere of Kino Europa we were discussing about Webpack, Browserify, Enterprise software production, HTML PDF app, servers, passenger, iOS development and much more.

Join us next week at the same time and *please give us hint for scheduling next CoffeeJS* (day in the week or hour) that would suit you more if you would like to join us.

See you next time.
